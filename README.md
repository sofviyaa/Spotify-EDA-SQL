## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of a Spotify dataset, which includes a variety of attributes related to tracks, albums, and artists, utilizing **SQL**. It encompasses a comprehensive process that involves normalizing a denormalized dataset, executing SQL queries to address specific questions, and enhancing query performance. The main objectives of this project are to refine advanced SQL skills and extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```
## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 4. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the dataset. The following queries encompass a range of analytical questions, from simple data retrieval and filtering to more complex aggregations and optimizations.

### 5. Query Optimization
In advanced stages, the focus shifts to improving query performance. Some optimization strategies include:
- **Indexing**: Adding indexes on frequently queried columns.
- **Query Execution Plan**: Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to review and refine query performance.

## 6 Practice Questions
1. What factors influence streaming numbers on Spotify?
2. Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.
```sql
WITH cte
AS
(SELECT 
	album,
	MAX(energy) as highest_energy,
	MIN(energy) as lowest_energery
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	album,
	highest_energy - lowest_energery as energy_diff
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
4. Identify the top 3 most popular tracks (by streams) for each album type (e.g., single, compilation) and calculate their average energy levels
5. For each artist, calculate the total number of streams and the average loudness of their tracks, and identify the artist with the highest average loudness.
6. Determine the percentage of tracks that have an official video and compare the average number of streams for tracks with and without official videos.
7. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.

## Query Optimization Technique 

To improve query performance, we carried out the following optimization process:

- **Initial Query Performance Analysis Using `EXPLAIN`**
    - We began by analyzing the performance of a query using the `EXPLAIN` function.
    - The query retrieved tracks based on the `artist` column, and the performance metrics were as follows:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **5.4 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **0.27 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result before optimization:

- **Index Creation on the `artist` Column**
    - To optimize the query performance, we created an index on the `artist` column. This ensures faster retrieval of rows where the artist is queried.
    - **SQL command** for creating the index:
      ```sql
      CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON spotify_tracks(artist);
      ```

- **Performance Analysis After Index Creation**
    - After creating the index, we ran the same query again and observed significant improvements in performance:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **0.142 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **0.151 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result after index creation:

- **Graphical Performance Comparison**
    - A graph illustrating the comparison between the initial query execution time and the optimized query execution time after index creation.
    - **Graph view** shows the significant drop in both execution and planning times:

This optimization shows how indexing can drastically reduce query time, improving the overall performance of our database operations in the Spotify project.
